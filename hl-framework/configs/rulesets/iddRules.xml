Rules for which insurance IDD document to show/send depending on:
* The associated agents' FSA status
* Where a quote has originally come from, and
* How it is bought

Note that evaluation continues after a match, allowing for cascaded rules.

There is a precondition for one rule, to account for when the original quote
isn't possible to be completed for whatever reason and it's requoted through the
buy method.

Rules are queried via REST interface at:
/rest/idd-rules/fetch/<fsatatus>/<quotebuy>/<buyby>[/<condition>]
