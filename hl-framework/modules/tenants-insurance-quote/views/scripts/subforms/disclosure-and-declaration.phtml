        <p>
            Any other facts known to you which are likely to affect acceptance or assessment of the insurance cover you are
            requesting must be disclosed. Should you have any doubt about what you should disclose, do not hesitate to tell us.
            Making sure we are informed is for your own protection, as failure to disclose may mean that your policy will not
            give you the protection you require, or perhaps you may invalidate the policy altogether. For your reference, we
            recommend you keep a record of any additional information given, including copies of letters.
