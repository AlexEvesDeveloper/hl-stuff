    <h3>About your reference</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Please ensure your applicant has signed this declaration and consent form and you have
            a copy on file.
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Your reference will be completed by HomeLet on behalf of your letting agent. HomeLet is part of the
        Barbon Insurance Group Limited and for the purposes of this application, Barbon is the Data Controller
        as defined in the Data Protection Act 1998 (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;).
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to complete your application, HomeLet will consult with a number of sources to verify the
        information, including a licensed credit reference agency. As a result of the information received:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            HomeLet may pass on any information supplied to your landlord and/or letting agent, including the
            results of any linked verification checks.
        </li>

        <li>
            By consulting with a credit reference agency, HomeLet will share your information with them and
            the agency may record the results of this search. This search may show how you conduct payments
            with other organisations. From time to time, this information may also be used for debt tracing
            and fraud prevention. You may request the name and address of the Credit Reference agency
            HomeLet use and you may also apply for a copy of the information they provided to HomeLet.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you default on your rental payments, HomeLet may record this on a centrally held database
            of defaulting tenants, and such a default could affect any future application for tenancies,
            credit, and/or insurance.
        </li>

        <li>
            HomeLet may use debt collection agencies or tracing agents to trace your whereabouts and
            recover any monies owed to HomeLet.
        </li>

        <li>
            If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud
            prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Information may be sent to you and your nominated referees by email. This information will only be
        sufficient enough to identify you and it won&rsquo;t be excessive; however you should be aware that
        information sent via electronic means can&rsquo;t be guaranteed to be secure.
